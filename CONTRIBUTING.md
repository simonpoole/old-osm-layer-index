### Adding new sources
The 'source' documents for this project are the .json files in `sources`. To add
a new imagery source, add a new file to this directory.

The format for sources is formally described in `schema.json` and can be checked
with `make check`.

#### Dates
Specifying reduced accuracy dates is complex. For simplicity, the schema allows 
a subset of ISO 8601 defined in [RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6)
except that a reduced precision date is allowed. For example, `2013-04-15T14:02:54.05+00:00` 
is a fully specified ISO 8601 date-time, `2013-04-15` could be used for just the date,
or `2013-04` for just the month, `2013` for just the year.

Implementations may round down the end date (e.g. consider `2013` the same as the 
start of `2013` so to specify imagery taken sometime in 2013, use `"start_date": "2013"`,
`"end_date": "2014"`.

### Building the combined files
After you've made a modification, run `make` to generate `imagery_all.xml`, `imagery_all.json`,
`imagery_all.geojson` and some further filtered files. Generating these files requires Python.
